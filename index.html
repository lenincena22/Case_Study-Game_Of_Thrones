                        <p><b>Jon Snow</b>,born <b>Aegon Targaryen</b>, is the son of <a href="">Lyanna Stark</a> and <a href="">Rhaegar Targaryen</a>,
                             the late <a href="">Prince of Dragonstone</a>.From infancy, Jon is presented as the son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's 
                             brother, and raised by Eddard alongside his lawful children at Winterfell but his true parentage is kept secret from 
                             everyone, including Jon himself. In order to escape his bastard status, Jon joins the Night's Watch and is eventually 
                             chosen as Lord Commander. However, he is later murdered in a mutiny and resurrected by the Red Priestess Melisandre. 
                             Free from his Night's Watch vows, Jon joins his cousin, Sansa Stark, in building an army and together they retake 
                             Winterfell from House Bolton, restoring House Stark's dominion over the North with Jon being declared the new King in the
                              North. However, after successfully capturing a wight and presenting it to the Lannisters as proof that the Army of the Deadis 
                              real, Jon pledges himself and his army to Daenerys Targaryen, Rhaegar's sister, and steps down as King of the North.

                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Secret origin</p>
                        <p>"His name is [...] If Robert finds out, he'll kill him. You know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me."</p>
                        <p>-Lyanna Stark to her brother Ned, speaking of her son Jon Snow.</p>
                        <p>Eighteen years before the War of the Five Kings, Rhaegar Targaryen allegedly abducted Lyanna Stark of Winterfell in a scandal that would lead to the outbreak of Robert's Rebellion. Rhaegar would eventually return to fight in the war, but not before leaving Lyanna behind at the Tower of Joy, guarded by Lord Commander Gerold Hightower and Ser Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard. Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, rode to war along with her betrothed, Robert Baratheon, to rescue his sister and avenge the deaths of their father and brother on the orders of Rhaegar's father, Aerys II, the Mad King.</p>
                        <p>Robert would ultimately kill Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident, effectively ensuring their victory in the war. After the Sack of King's Landing, Ned continued south in search of his sister and ultimately found her at the Tower of Joy in the Red Mountains at the border of Dorne. Ned and his companions engaged in a final fierce melee with the remaining Targaryen Kingsguard, which resulted in the deaths of all combatants save Ned himself and Howland Reed. After defeating the last of the Kingsguard, Ned rushed into the tower to save his sister - only to find Lyanna dying from childbirth, having just given birth to Rhaegar's own son. Desperate to protect the life of her newborn child, a fading Lyanna pleaded with Ned to promise her that he would keep her son safe, and his true heritage hidden from Robert as he had been Rhaegar's most bitter enemy. Furthermore, the boy's existence was a potential threat to Robert's claim to the Iron Throne after the deaths of Rhaegar's other children, Rhaenys and Aegon, by his wife Elia Martell, who also perished, during the Sack of King's Landing. In accordance with her last wish, Ned resolved to pass Lyanna's son off as his own bastard son and raise him in his home castle - a great blow to his honor as he knew that his decision would shame both himself and his lady wife, Catelyn Tully.</p>
                        <p>Ned decided not to use his nephew's birth name, which Lyanna revealed to him in her final moments - apparently because it was a Targaryen-style name which would have given away his real parentage. Instead, he chose to give the baby the name "Jon" after his great friend and mentor Jon Arryn, Lord of the Vale, whom he loved like a second father. The boy also grew up using the surname "Snow", as is customary for acknowledged bastards in the North. In truth, however, "Jon" may not be a bastard at all. Rhaegar apparently had his marriage to Elia annulled and married another, presumably Lyanna.</p>
                        <h3>Early Life</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Jon Snow spent the next seventeen years being raised in Winterfell as Lord Eddard's illegitimate son, alongside his trueborn children with his wife. Understandably, Eddard never told anyone, including Catelyn or Jon himself, who his mother was or even if she was still alive.</p>
                        <p>When pressed by King Robert Baratheon, whom he couldn't deny an answer, Ned went as far as to concoct a vague explanation that Jon's mother was some lowborn woman named "Wylla" that he met during the war. Lady Catelyn's eldest son, Robb, would be acknowledged unquestionably as Eddard's heir, but Jon was otherwise never treated much differently than her younger sons Bran and Rickon</p>
                        <p>Due to his bastard status, Jon grew up feeling like an outsider at Winterfell. Although Lord Stark would see that he was well-treated, Jon's attendance at Winterfell's more "formal" occasions was restricted and he would even be barred from sitting inside at the Lord's table with his family so as not to offend important guests. Otherwise, Jon still lived better than many bastard-born children and was well-raised by Eddard as his own. He was loved by his father and siblings, was never hungry or poor, lived in his father's castle, and had a noble's upbringing. Jon received a highborn education from Maester Luwin and a young lord's martial training from Winterfell's Master-at-Arms, Ser Rodrik Cassel. Of the Stark children, Jon was very close friends with Robb - given that they were roughly the same age, being regular companions in training and riding. He was also close with both Bran and Rickon, as well as having a friendly rival in Lord Eddard's ward, Theon Greyjoy.</p>

                        <p>Despite sharing a happy marriage, Jon's presence at Winterfell would serve as a constant source of friction between Eddard and Catelyn. Because Jon was never legitimized, Catelyn was never his "stepmother" in any sense of the term or had any obligations to him whatsoever. She never mistreated Jon but she was cold towards him and avoided him whenever possible, viewing him only as a living reminder of the one time that Eddard had dishonored her. Catelyn would later confess to her daughter-in-law Talisa about how Jon caught the pox when he was a child, and she stayed with him through the night and prayed to the gods to let him live out of guilt for previously praying for his death, accepting that the boy was not to blame for her husband's sin, though it was still not enough to make her love Jon, something she would eventually come to regret.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Jon reaches Hardhome with his companions. After Tormund kills the Lord of Bones for challenging him, he and Jon go inside a hut to speak with the leaders of the clans. Though the wildlings are prepared to kill Jon for murdering Mance, Tormund stands up for him and reveals that Jon in fact killed Mance out of mercy. Jon offers to share the dragonglass weapons with the wildlings and allow them to settle on land south of the Wall, if they promise to aid the Night's Watch in the coming battle against the White Walkers: even if they and all the men of the Seven Kingdoms are not enough to stop them, they can at least die fighting. Five thousand wildlings agree while the rest decide to stay, though Tormund hopes more will come around with time. However, as they are preparing to leave, they are all attacked by an army of wights. Jon fights his way to the hut to retrieve the dragonglass daggers, but he is ambushed by a White Walker. They fight for a while and Jon is almost killed until he retrieves Longclaw. To the surprise of both Jon and the White Walker, Longclaw doesn't shatter from the cold of the Walker's weapon when he uses it to parry his attack - because it is made of Valyrian steel, forged with dragon-fire and spells.</p>
                        <h2>Relationships</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Main: Jon Snow and Ygritte</p>
                        <p>Ygritte: She was Jon's first love, although in their first encounter she tries to seduce and cheat him. When Jon infiltrates the Wildlings, they become lovers and Jon really falls in love with her, but ultimately he choses his vows for the Night's Watch over her. Ygritte shoots him with three arrows but her feelings couldn´t bring herself to kill him. In the Battle of Castle Black, Ygritte was killed by Olly and died in the Jon's arms, her body was cremated by a devastated Jon.</p>
                        <p>Main: Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen</p>
                        <p>Daenerys Targaryen: The Mad King's daughter and the youngest sister of Jon's father, Prince Rhaegar, making her his aunt by blood. Having been summoned from Winterfell to bend the knee to Daenerys, Jon initially refuses on the grounds that they need to ally against the Night King and the army of the dead instead of removing Cersei from the Iron Throne.</p>
